== Presentation

This reporter writes access logs to a file, by corresponding one line to one request access to gateway.

== Compatibility matrix

|===
|Plugin version    | APIM version | JDK version

| 3.x              | 4.x          | 17
| 2.x              | 3.x          | 8
|===


== Line format

For now, line format is defined as the following:

    [TIMESTAMP] (LOCAL_IP) REMOTE_IP API KEY METHOD PATH STATUS LENGTH TOTAL_RESPONSE_TIME

Where:

- `TIMESTAMP` is the timestamp from which request began to be processed by gateway;
- `LOCAL_IP` is the local host's IP, i.e., the Gravitee *node*'s IP which have processed request;
- `REMOTE_IP` is the remote host's IP;
- `API` is the requested API name;
- `KEY` is the key used to request to API;
- `METHOD` is the HTTP method contained into the request;
- `PATH` is the HTTP path contained into the request;
- `STATUS` is the HTTP response status received from the API;
- `LENGTH` is the HTTP `Content-Length` value received from the API.
- `TOTAL_RESPONSE_TIME` is the total response time to process request (API + *gateway* response time).
